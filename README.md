# Introdcution 
Hello everyone, my name is Michael Anthony Barnes III. I love gaming, and one of my favorite games is Roblox, which contains a variety of different games that you can play—kind of like Steam. I love taking long walks with my dog, and I like to meditate so that I can have a clear head and eliminate any anxiety that I might have at that specific moment. I attend Ivy Tech Community College, and I've been attending for three years now. I am currently majoring in Software Development. Not too long ago, I achieved my Software Development certification, which made me very happy and proud of myself. My main goal at Ivy Tech is to earn my associate degree in Software Development. Once I achieve that, I plan to transfer to another college for two more years to earn my bachelor’s degree in Software Development.
